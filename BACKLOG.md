# Backlog

Open items not yet scheduled into a task. Each entry keeps the context that led to it — not just
"what," but "why this matters" — so picking it up later doesn't require re-deriving the reasoning
from scratch.

## #1: `/orc-*` command namespace with parameter routing and stack defaults — a future sub-project, not v1

Raised by direflail while reviewing the Orclab v1 (process core) design (2026-09-04), explicitly
as spitballing to check whether it should change v1's scope. It shouldn't, and doesn't — v1 (see
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-orclab-v1-process-core-design.md`) is three behavioral skills
(`backlog-discipline`, `release-checklist`, `environment-registry`); this idea is a different kind
of thing entirely: a command/intent layer for directing *new* project work, not a discipline for
tracking existing project state.

**The idea, as described:**
- A `/orc-` command base, e.g. `/orc-code` to signal "code needs to be written."
- Subcommand parameters that change behavior significantly — e.g. `/orc-code refactor` means the
  project is changing language or language version, which should trigger an extended
  question-asking phase to nail down scope before anything happens (echoes the brainstorming
  skill's own "classify, then ask" shape, but scoped specifically to refactor/migration work).
- Natural-language routing: a plain request like "I'd like to use /orc-code to write a hello world
  project in Java" should be recognized as the `/orc-code` path with `java` as the inferred
  language parameter, without requiring the literal command syntax.
- Defaults, per language and per project type — e.g. Java desktop apps default to
  Java + Spring + JavaFX — with version/specifics still confirmed via questions rather than
  silently assumed.

**Why this matters:** if useful, this becomes the primary way Orclab gets used day-to-day
(starting new work), which is a different value proposition than v1's "keep track of what's
already true about a project." Worth designing well, not bolted onto v1 as an afterthought.

**Implementation mechanism, confirmed live (2026-09-04, corrected from this entry's own first
draft, which wrongly guessed plugins couldn't do this):** Claude Code plugins register real slash
commands via a `commands/*.md` file per command, with an `argument-hint` frontmatter field and
`$ARGUMENTS`/`$1`/`$2`-style positional parsing in the body — a real installed example,
`code-modernization`'s `modernize-assess.md`, takes `<system-dir> [--show-secrets] | --portfolio
<parent-dir>` and branches on `$ARGUMENTS` directly. This directly supports the `/orc-code
refactor`-style subcommand-as-parameter idea with no new mechanism needed. Still open: how many
commands beyond `/orc-code` are needed (this entry only describes the one example given), how the
natural-language-routing case ("use /orc-code to write X" without the literal slash) gets
recognized without a literal invocation, and how per-language/per-stack defaults get
stored/overridden per project.

**Next step, when picked up:** a fresh `superpowers:brainstorming` pass (Architectural path,
given it's a new subsystem with its own command surface and inference logic), separate from v1's
spec and plan.

## #2: A base visual/design-system layer for apps Orclab helps build — a future sub-project, not v1

Raised by direflail (2026-09-04), separately from #1 and from v1's process-core scope: right now
Orclab has no opinion at all about how the apps it helps build actually *look* — how desktop apps,
mobile apps, and web apps are styled, scaled, and made to behave visually, across platforms. The
concrete comparison direflail gave: Caterpillar (their employer) has an internal framework called
"Blocks," built on React, that fills exactly this role there — but it's employer-owned and can't
be used outside work, so a real gap exists for personal/other-project work.

**What this is NOT**: not another web framework (React/Vue/Angular/Svelte) — those were already
ruled out as beside the point in this same conversation; direflail was explicit that the ask is
about the visual/design layer that sits *on top of* those, not the framework itself. Also not
CSS-utility libraries (Bootstrap, Semantic UI) or admin-panel generators (Refine, react-admin) —
those came up in initial research but don't match the "controls look/scale/behavior across
desktop and web platforms" framing once direflail clarified the actual ask.

**Real candidates surfaced by research (not yet evaluated hands-on, not yet decided)**, roughly in
three layers that would likely need to be picked in combination, not as a single choice:

- **Full design systems** (closest analogs to Caterpillar's Blocks — token-driven theming plus a
  complete component set plus cross-platform scaling rules): Material Design 3 (Google), Fluent UI
  (Microsoft — adaptive layouts scaling across Windows desktop/web/mobile), Carbon (IBM —
  framework-agnostic: React/Angular/Vue/Svelte/web components), Ant Design (strong for data-dense,
  desktop-style apps), GitHub Primer (developer-tool focused).
- **UI component libraries** (the practical implementation layer): shadcn/ui (copy-paste model on
  Radix primitives + Tailwind — you own the source directly, no vendored dependency to work
  around), Chakra UI, MUI (works for web and Electron desktop), Radix UI (unstyled, accessible
  primitives only — maximum control, bring your own visual design).
- **Design tokens** (the actual cross-platform-scaling mechanism underneath either of the above):
  Style Dictionary (Amazon — transforms tokens into CSS/iOS/Android/etc. — the current industry
  standard), Diez (compose tokens in TypeScript, compile to native iOS/Android/Web libraries), the
  W3C Design Tokens spec (stable v1 as of October 2025 — vendor-neutral token format).

No hands-on evaluation of any of these has happened yet — this is raw research, not a decision.
An initial framing (not a recommendation to commit to) leaned toward Fluent UI or Carbon as the
closest single-framework analogs to Blocks, versus shadcn/ui + Radix + Tailwind + a token system
as the more modern, full-code-ownership alternative — but this needs real comparison against
Orclab's actual target platforms (desktop apps, mobile apps, web apps specifically) before
choosing, not just a feature-list comparison.

**Why this matters:** without this, every app Orclab helps scaffold or build would need its visual
styling decided from scratch each time, with no consistent base — the same kind of repeated,
undistilled decision-making this whole framework project exists to avoid.

**Next step, when picked up:** a fresh `superpowers:brainstorming` pass (Architectural path — this
is a new subsystem, and the choice of base framework has wide-reaching downstream consequences for
anything built on it), separate from v1's spec/plan and from #1's command-layer work. Likely needs
its own research spike comparing 2-3 real candidates against Orclab's actual target platforms
before a design gets proposed, not a decision made from the comparison table alone.
