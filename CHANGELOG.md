# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here, newest first.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- `/orc-version` — set or increment the current project's version, draft a changelog entry from
  real git history, tag the commit, and optionally cut a real GitHub Release (`/orc-version
  release`).
- `/orc-help` (and `/orc` as an alias) — reports Orclab's own running version and a synopsis of
  its available commands, aware of whether it's running in Orclab's own repo or a project that
  has it installed.
- The `.orclab/` directory convention — reserved, gitignored, per-project home for Orclab's own
  future private bookkeeping (not yet populated by anything in this release).
